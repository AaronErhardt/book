# The Little Book of Rust Books

This book is a treasure-trove of Rust books in [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) format:
* [Official books](./official.md) maintained at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Unofficial books](./unofficial.md) maintained elsewhere
* [Application books](./applications.md) on specific Rust applications

If you know of others, why not submit a [pull request](https://github.com/lborb/book/pulls)?

For a list of non-[mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) format books,
see, for example, [Rust Books](https://github.com/sger/RustBooks).

Although, [Learn Rust the Dangerous Way](http://cliffle.com/p/dangerust/) isn't
actually in [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) format, it's similar
and gets an honourable mention here.
